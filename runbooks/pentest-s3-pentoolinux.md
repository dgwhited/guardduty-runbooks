PenTest:S3/PentooLinux
----------------------


### An S3 API was invoked from a Pentoo Linux machine.


**Default severity: Medium**


 * **Data source:** CloudTrail data events for S3

This finding informs you that a machine running Pentoo Linux is making S3 API calls using credentials that belong to your AWS account. Your credentials might be compromised. Pentoo Linux is a popular penetration testing tool that security professionals use to identify weaknesses in EC2 instances that require patching. Attackers also use this tool to find EC2 configuration weaknesses and gain unauthorized access to your AWS environment.


**Remediation recommendations:**


If this activity is unexpected for the associated principal, it may indicate that the credentials have been exposed or your S3 permissions are not restrictive enough.
